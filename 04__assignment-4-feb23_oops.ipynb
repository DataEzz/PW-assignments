    "Ans:A class is considered as a blueprint of objects. We can think of the class as a sketch (prototype) of a house. It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows, etc. Based on these descriptions we build the house. House is the object.\n",
    "An object is called an instance of a class. For example, suppose Bike is a class then we can create objects like bike1, bike2, etc from the class."

    "Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:Self represents the instance of the class. By using the “self” we can access the attributes and methods of the class in Python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments. The reason you need to use self. is because Python does not use the @ syntax to refer to instance attributes."
